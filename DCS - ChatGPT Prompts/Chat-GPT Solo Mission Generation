Chat-GPT Mission Generation Prompt:https://chatgpt.com/

I want to design a realistic mission for DCS with minimal input from me. Help me create a mission with the following details:

1. Map Selection: [User selects from available DCS maps] (e.g., Nevada Test and Training Range, Caucasus, Syria, Persian Gulf, Normandy, etc.)

2. Mission Type: [User specifies one mission type from the following options]:

	Air-to-Air Combat (Dogfight)
	Air-to-Ground (Strike)
	SEAD (Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses)
	CAS (Close Air Support)
	Reconnaissance
	Other (If needed, specify a mission type)
Note: For air-to-air missions, select a fighter aircraft. For SEAD or strike missions, select a multirole or bomber aircraft.

3. Backstory: [ChatGPT will generate a random, realistic backstory based on the selected mission type. Example: For Air-to-Air Combat: "A recent surge of enemy bombers has been detected, heading toward a friendly border. You are tasked with intercepting the bombers and engaging their escort fighters before they can reach their target." For SEAD: "Intelligence reports that a high-value target is located near a heavily defended enemy airbase. The player must neutralize the SAM sites to enable a subsequent strike mission."]

4. Aircraft: [User specifies the aircraft the player will use. Example: "F-16" or "F/A-18" or "Su-33", etc.]

5. Loadout Suggestion: [ChatGPT will suggest a loadout based on the selected aircraft and mission type, aiming for realism. Users can tailor this as needed.]

6. Enemy Forces: [User specifies the number and type of enemy forces (e.g., "a small group of Su-27s and a convoy of ground vehicles"). ChatGPT will help expand on the details.]

7. Difficulty Level: [User chooses from one of the following levels]:

	Easy (Minimal opposition, casual experience)
	Medium (Realistic opposition, moderate challenge)
	Hard (Aggressive and realistic enemies)
	Mission Design Advice: [ChatGPT will provide basic steps for mission creation in the DCS editor, such as setting up objectives, triggers, enemy spawns, airfields, and optional customization for advanced users.]

Solo Missions:

Objective Design: The mission will focus on the player completing the mission alone, with AI enemies and potential AI wingmen. If there are AI wingmen:
"Would you like to have AI wingmen assist the player? If yes, specify their roles (e.g., 'AI wingman to provide cover during strike mission')."
"Should the player complete the mission objectives solo or with assistance from AI (e.g., air-to-air combat with an AI wingman providing support)?"
AI Behavior: "Specify the AI behavior for any friendly forces (e.g., 'AI wingmen are passive and defensive' or 'AI wingmen aggressively engage enemies')."

Mission Design Advice:
ChatGPT will provide basic steps for mission creation in the DCS editor, such as setting up objectives, triggers, enemy spawns, airfields, and optional customization for advanced users. Additionally, it will offer advice based on whether the mission is for solo play, AI wingmen, or multiplayer.

Optional Advanced Customization (for experienced users):
Users can specify more advanced parameters like AI behavior, flight routes, and trigger-based events for more dynamic mission design.
